## 🏗️ Architecture Overview & Tech Stack

The application adheres to a strict **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** model:

### 1. Core Services (The Brain - Electron Main Process)

This is the secure Node.js environment. It handles all I/O, persistence, and secrets.

- **Desktop Runtime:** **Electron** (chosen for `BrowserView`/`Webview` control to support DOM injection).
- **Database:** **SQLite** (via `better-sqlite3` driver) with direct synchronous access in Main Process. WAL mode enabled for concurrent reads.
- **Data Layer:** **Drizzle ORM** (TypeScript type-safety for queries, raw SQL timestamps in milliseconds).
- **Security:** **Secure Storage** using Electron's `safeStorage` API for encrypting API credentials at rest.
- **API:** Custom wrapper based on `axios` with retry and backoff logic.
- **Background Jobs:** Node.js timers and asynchronous operations.

### 2. Renderer (The Face - UI Process)

This is the sandboxed browser environment. It handles presentation.

- **Frontend:** **React + TypeScript**
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** (modern UI, good baseline A11y).
- **State Management:** **Zustand** (minimalistic state layer, aligned with KISS/YAGNI).
- **Data Fetching:** **TanStack Query (React Query)** (caching, loading states, API boundary).

### 3. Security Boundary (The Gatekeeper)

- **IPC Architecture:** Controller-based IPC handlers with `BaseController` for centralized error handling and validation. Type-safe dependency injection via DI Container.
- **IPC Bridge:** Strictly typed TypeScript interface (`bridge.ts`) used by the Renderer to communicate with the Main Process.
- **Security:** **Context Isolation** enforced globally; no direct Node.js access from the Renderer.
- **Encryption:** API credentials encrypted using Electron's `safeStorage` API. Decryption only occurs in Main Process when needed for API calls.
- **Provider Pattern:** Multi-booru support via `IBooruProvider` interface. Current implementations: Rule34.xxx, Gelbooru.

**📖 For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture.md).**

## 📐 Product Structure

The application is organized into the following main sections accessible via the Sidebar:

- **Updates (Subscriptions)** - View new posts from tracked artists and tag subscriptions
- **Browse (All posts)** - Browse all cached posts with advanced filtering and search
- **Favorites (Account favorites)** - Access your account favorites synced from the booru
- **Tracked (Artists/Tags management)** - Manage tracked artists, tags, and subscriptions
- **Settings** - Configure sync behavior, storage limits, security, and database maintenance

## 🎨 Core UX Principles

### Global Top Bar

A unified Top Bar appears on all content pages providing:

- **Search** - Quick search across posts, tags, and artists
- **Filters** - Rating, media type, tags, date range
- **Sort** - Sort by date added, posted date, rating, etc.
- **View Toggle** - Switch between grid, list, and masonry layouts
- **Sync Status** - Real-time sync progress indicator with last sync timestamp

### Viewer Experience

The full-screen viewer provides a polished media viewing experience:

- **Full-screen Mode** - Immersive viewing with auto-hide controls
- **Navigation** - Arrow keys (←/→) for previous/next post
- **Hotkeys:**
  - `Esc` - Close viewer
  - `←/→` - Navigate between posts
  - `F` - Toggle favorite
  - `V` - Mark as viewed
  - `T` - Toggle tags drawer
- **Auto-hide Bars** - Top and bottom bars automatically hide after inactivity
- **Tags Drawer** - Right-side sheet (Slide-over) with clickable tags:
  - Click tag to add filter (`+tag`)
  - Right-click or modifier key to exclude (`-tag`)
  - Visual indicators for active filters

### Progressive Image Loading

Optimized image loading strategy for performance:

- **Preview URL** - Low-resolution blurred preview (instant display)
- **Sample URL** - Medium-resolution sample (loaded in gallery)
- **File URL** - Full-resolution original (loaded only in viewer)

This ensures fast initial page loads while maintaining high-quality viewing experience.

### Gallery Cards

Post cards in gallery views include informative overlays:

- **Viewed Badge** - Indicator for already viewed posts
- **Favorite Badge** - Star icon for favorited posts
- **Rating Badge** - Visual indicator (Safe/Questionable/Explicit)
- **Media Type Badge** - Icon indicating image or video content

## 🔄 Sync & Background

### Auto-sync on Startup

Automatic synchronization when the application starts:

- **Toggle Setting** - Enable/disable auto-sync in Settings
- **Background Execution** - Sync runs in background without blocking UI
- **Progress Indicators** - Real-time sync status in Top Bar

### Periodic Sync

Continuous synchronization while the application is running:

- **Configurable Interval** - Set sync frequency in Settings (e.g., every 30 minutes)
- **Smart Rate Limiting** - Prevents API spam with intelligent backoff
- **Last Sync Status** - Display last successful sync timestamp
- **Respectful Polling** - Implements exponential backoff and respects API limits

## ⚙️ Settings
